# ![Aban](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sarvarian/Godot_Aban/main/addons/aban/icons/abna.png) Aban
 A Game System for more accessible game design

# The Problem
 Why every time that I want to make a character moves, I need to wrote another movement script!!!

# The Jurney
 Just like a good Game-Engine, a good Game-System needs good Games to show it's flawed and possibilities for growth.
 So I start remaking Computer-Games from the oldest days of computers to help Aban grow and help me to become a better game designer.

# Why Godot
 Godot is not perfect, but it has a balance between Performance, Ease-of-Use, and Features.
Actually! there is another game engine that has this kind of balance. "Unreal Engine"

# Why Not UnrealEngine
 Because when the engine decided to compile thousands of shaders, it took my computer hours to do so.
 When I can get a better computer system, I probably switch. Until then, Godot is a perfect match for my skills and the computing systems that I work on them.

# What is a Game System
 It is a layer between Game-Engine and the Game itself. It helps Game-Designer to make and design his dream game faster and easier.

# Why naming Aban
 Cause it starts with 'A' 'B' and then 'A' again, and there's a high chance that it goes above other directories.
